# Callisto: Entropy based test generation and data quality assessment for Machine Learning Systems

Callisto is a novel test generation and data quality assessment framework. To the best of our knowledge, Callisto is the first 
blackbox framework to leverage the uncertainty in the prediction and systematically generate new test cases for ML classifiers. 
Our evaluation of Callisto on four real world data sets reveals thousands of errors. We also show that leveraging the 
uncertainty in prediction can increase the number of erroneous test cases up to a factor of 20, as compared to when no such 
knowledge is used for testing.

Callisto has the capability to detect low quality data in the datasets that may contain mislabelled data. We conduct and 
present an extensive user study to validate the results of Callisto on identifying low quality data from four state-of-the-art 
real world datasets.

### Dependencies
* Python 3
* Keras
* Tensorflow==1.15.0
* Random
* Pickle
* Math
* Matplotlib
* OpenCV
* h5py
* ipython
* numpy

In case of any unforseen dependencies, a detailed ```pip freeze``` of the system used to develop Callisto can be found 
[here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Cbcfiv3Y7Fz3jKcwv-h2EWLBY37orPuwbflp_C8P2ok/edit?usp=sharing) 


### Usage

* Please ensure all the dependencies are correctly installed. To ensure this, you may run the pre-trained models
* Add your own model to the ```models``` folder in the correct folder 
* Change the ```model1_file``` variable in the Test Generation and Data Quality ```ipynb``` file
* One can run the files to find the corresponding errors and data quality issues

### Organisation 
Each folder below represents the dataset under test. We have four datasets under test namely:
* MNIST-Digit
* Fashion MNIST
* CIFAR-10
* SVHN

We also have a ``User Study`` folder which has the user study data in .csv format and accompanying scripts to analyze the
same.

### Test Generation
For each dataset there are four transformations we experiment on. These are Panning, 2D Rotation, Affine and Perspective. 
The python notebook can be found under Test Generation under each dataset folder. 

Please change 'MINI_DATASET_TEST' to False if you want to run the full datasets. Once it is set to true, the test generation framework will only run for a subset images in the interest of time.


### Data Quality
For each dataset we try to find low entropy (this means that the model is fairly certain of the prediction), but the prediction 
for these images is incorrect. Intuitively, this may mean that the data may be mislabelled [1]. 

We also highlight some prominent examples of low data quality in each notebook 

### Auxiliary Files
  For the SVHN dataset, the dataset *needs* to be downloaded. It can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zxz1QC5ZD6eREwLfjv1NVdUaZxV0hp4U/view). Please make a folder 'data' under SVHN.
